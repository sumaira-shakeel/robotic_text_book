# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This repository contains the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook - a comprehensive educational resource designed for K-12 teachers, high-school/early-university students, and beginners learning Physical AI, humanoid robotics, and embodied intelligence.

## Overview

The textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Chapter 1: ROS 2 Architecture
- Chapter 2: Python (rclpy) Nodes
- Chapter 3: URDF Modeling
- Chapter 4: Launch Files and Parameters
- Chapter 5: LLM-Based Robot Control

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Chapter 6: Digital Twins Overview
- Chapter 7: Gazebo Physics Simulation
- Chapter 8: Importing URDF/SDF Models
- Chapter 9: Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, RGB-D, IMU)
- Chapter 10: Unity Scenes for High-Fidelity HRI

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Chapter 11: Isaac Sim Basics and Photorealistic Environments
- Chapter 12: Isaac ROS Perception Stack (VSLAM, 3D detection, semantic mapping)
- Chapter 13: Nav2 Navigation for Humanoid Movement
- Chapter 14: Reinforcement Learning Workflows in Isaac Sim
- Chapter 15: Sim-to-Real Transfer Methods and Challenges

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
- Chapter 16: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems Overview
- Chapter 17: Speech Recognition Pipeline (Whisper → ROS Command)
